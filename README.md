# TryCatch
Hi-Tech Tools and Tackle Tracker

This will be my attempt at a rull react wep app. The goal is to have a web-based app, but also include offline/native app functionality to allow usage when there is no cell coverage on the water. The app will track all information about your fishing hobby. 
- Favorite spots
- Fishing buddies
- Trip planning 
- Equipment and vessel information, (photos & serials incase of theft or loss)
- Trip history and photos of catches/trips
- Public Timeline of users' publicly-shared photos
